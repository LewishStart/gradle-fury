*"Before I could pull the trigger, I was hit by lightning and bitten by a cobra. I blacked out, and
saw images of ancient Shaolin temples and monks mastering the art of kung-fu. There was an ancient
prophecy about a new form of kung-fu so powerful, only one man can master it: The Chosen One. When I
woke up, I saw the kung-fu master running towards me. I could feel my body mutate, into some sort of
kung-fu freak of nature." --Kung Fury*


Purpose
-------

An alternative helper to upload multi-flavored Gradle Android Artifacts to Maven repositories with
pretty POM files using simple property configuration.


Usage
-----

Coming soon!  (I promise!)

Acknowledgements
----------------

I absolutely want to extend a very sincere thanks to [Chris Banes](https://github.com/chrisbanes),
whose work served as the foundation and inspiration for this work.  I would not be anywhere had it
not been for his outstanding efforts to overcome several of the glaring deficiencies within Gradle's
"support" of basic development lifecycle operations -- you know, like simple artifact publishing.
